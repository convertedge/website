  items:
    - label: Does Convertege work with any form type?
      content: Generally yes. We work with the main marketing automations and CRM forms - like Hubspot, Marketo, Pardot, Eloqua, and with the main CMS forms like Wordpress, Webflow, Wix etc. It may not work well with other form shortening services like Typeform. Not sure it works? You can test it very simply or ask us.
    - label: Do I need technical skills or a tech person to get started?
      content: No. Convertedge was built with simplicity in mind. We aim to simplify the auto lead enrichment and form shortening process in such a way that any team member can do it. If you also want to enrich and not just short your form you’ll need access to your form handler though, and be able to add fields to it.
    - label: How do you enrich the lead data?
      content: We use the email as the base source for enrichment. Once the user submits their email, we enrich this data with our huge database and also other very well known tools to maximize coverage.
    - label: What happens if you can’t enrich a lead’s data?
      content: In case we didn’t find enrichment data that is based on a the email submitted by the user, your original form will appear for the user, and they’ll just need to fill it in as they normally should have done.
    - label: How does pricing work?
      content: Pricing is based on usage. We charge one credit if we manage to enrich a lead. In case weren't able to enrich it, then you won't be charged for this form submission, and the original form fields will be exposed to the user to fill in (as originally created by you). You can also set a cap on how much total you’re willing to invest in form shortening per month. Meaning it will stop shortening and enriching a lead when you reach the cap, and your original form will be displayed, until the next billing cycle begins.
    - label: Can I stop at any time?
      content: Yes. You can stop at any time at the pay as you go and monthly plans.
    - label: How long does it really take to install, it’s not 5 minutes right?
      content: Yes it is. 5 minutes, plus making coffee. Try it, if it took you longer, email us with how long it took you.
    - label: Does it work with any email? Can you enrich personal emails?
      content: Generally speaking - yes. But enrichment databases support up to 10% of personal email discovery.

  - label: Does Convertege work with any form type?
    content: Generally yes. We work with the main marketing automations and CRM forms - like Hubspot, Marketo, Pardot, Eloqua, and with the main CMS forms like Wordpress, Webflow, Wix etc. It may not work well with other form shortening services like Typeform. Not sure it works? You can test it very simply or ask us.
  - label: Do I need technical skills or a tech person to get started?
    content: No. Convertedge was built with simplicity in mind. We aim to simplify the auto lead enrichment and form shortening process in such a way that any team member can do it. If you also want to enrich and not just short your form you’ll need access to your form handler though, and be able to add fields to it.
  - label: How do you enrich the lead data?
    content: We use the email as the base source for enrichment. Once the user submits their email, we enrich this data with our huge database and also other very well known tools to maximize coverage.
  - label: What happens if you can’t enrich a lead’s data?
    content: In case we didn’t find enrichment data that is based on a the email submitted by the user, your original form will appear for the user, and they’ll just need to fill it in as they normally should have done.
  - label: How does pricing work?
    content: Pricing is based on usage. You start with a small package of 50 enrichment credits per month which is at $40 per month. Billing continues on a monthly cycle based, unused credits from the previous month are transferred as well to the next billing cycle, and you’ll be charged again based on the plan you’ve selected.
  - label: Can I stop at any time?
    content: Yes. You can stop at any time at the pay as you go and monthly plans.
  - label: How long does it really take to install, it’s not 5 minutes right?
    content: Yes it is. 5 minutes, plus making coffee. Try it, if it took you longer, email us with how long it took you.
  - label: Does it work with any email? Can you enrich personal emails?
    content: Generally speaking - yes. But enrichment databases support up to 10% of personal email discovery.
